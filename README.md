<h1><a href ="https://busttech.github.io/deploy/" target = "_blank">Easy Test Solution</a></h1>-->In this I performed a  exercise of animint2manual and the exercise was :-><ul>Try changing the region legend to an income legend. Hint: you need to use the same aes(color=income) specification for all geoms. You may want to use scale_color_manual with a sequential color palette, see RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all(type="seq") . </ul>     -->To view the the solutioncode of exercise click on the this link https://github.com/busttech/test-solutions-of-animint/blob/main/Easy-test-solution/solutioncode.r

In this test we had converted the animation package in animint ,<br>
