<h1><a href ="https://busttech.github.io/deploy/" target = "_blank">Easy Test Solution</a></h1>-->In this I performed a  exercise of animint2manual and the exercise was :-><ul>Try changing the region legend to an income legend. Hint: you need to use the same aes(color=income) specification for all geoms.
